## 1. Why is error logging important in a frontend application, and what information should be included in error logs?

**🛠️ Answer:**  
Error logging is crucial in frontend applications because:

- **🔍 Identifies & diagnoses** issues affecting users.
- **🛡️ Improves stability** and user experience.
- **📊 Tracks recurring errors** for proactive fixes.

**📋 Information to include in error logs:**

- **❌ Error message** (stack trace, error type).
- **⏰ Timestamp** (when the error occurred).
- **👤 User context** (user ID, session ID, browser/device).
- **🌍 Environment details** (app version, OS, browser).
- **🖱️ Action leading to the error** (API call, UI interaction).
- **⚠️ Severity level** (warning, error, critical).

---

## 2. Explain the significance of tracking feature usage in a front-end application.

**📈 Answer:**  
Tracking feature usage helps:

- **👀 Understand user behavior** (popular vs. unused features).
- **✨ Improve UX** by optimizing high-traffic features.
- **🎯 Prioritize development** based on real data.
- **📉 Measure success** (conversion rates, engagement).
- **🔍 Identify pain points** (user drop-offs).

---

## 3. Discuss the benefits and challenges of user tracking in improving the user experience.

**⚖️ Answer:**  
**✅ Benefits:**

- **🎨 Personalization** (tailored recommendations).
- **🔧 UX improvements** (heatmaps, session recordings).
- **📊 Data-driven decisions** (A/B testing).

**❌ Challenges:**

- **🔒 Privacy concerns** (GDPR, CCPA compliance).
- **📉 Data accuracy** (tracking inconsistencies).
- **🐌 Performance overhead** (excessive logging).

## 4. How do you measure frontend performance, and what tools or metrics do you consider?

**⏱️ Answer:**  
**📊 Key Metrics:**

- **🚀 Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)** – Loading performance.
- **⚡ First Input Delay (FID)** – Interactivity.
- **🖼️ Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)** – Visual stability.
- **⏳ Time to First Byte (TTFB)** – Server response time.

**🛠️ Tools:**

- **🔦 Lighthouse** (performance audits).
- **🌐 WebPageTest** (detailed analysis).
- **🛠️ Chrome DevTools** (debugging).
- **🚨 Sentry/New Relic** (real-user monitoring).

---

## 5. Explain the impact of performance optimization on user experience and business metrics.

**💡 Answer:**

- **😊 Better UX** → Faster load times reduce bounce rates.
- **💰 Higher conversions** → Amazon: **100ms delay = 1% sales drop**.
- **🔍 Improved SEO** → Google ranks faster sites higher.
- **📉 Lower costs** → Optimized apps use fewer resources.

---

## 6. Define the error threshold and explain how it can be used to monitor application health.

**⚠️ Answer:**  
An **error threshold** is a predefined limit for acceptable error rates (e.g.,
**1% of requests**).  
**How it helps:**

- **🔔 Alerts when errors exceed normal levels.**
- **🩺 Detects outages early.**
- **⚡ Triggers auto-scaling or rollbacks.**

```bash
ERROR THRESHOLD MONITORING

    📊 THRESHOLD LEVELS
            │
    ┌───────┼─────────┐
    ▼       ▼         ▼
┌──────┐ ┌──────┐ ┌──────┐
│GREEN │ │YELLOW│ │ RED  │
│ <1%  │ │1-5%  │ │ >5%  │
└──────┘ └──────┘ └──────┘
   │        │        │
   ▼        ▼        ▼
 Normal   Warning  Critical
```

### Threshold Categories:

```bash
🔍 ERROR TYPES & THRESHOLDS

JavaScript Errors: < 2%
API Failures:      < 1%
Performance:       < 3%
Crash Rate:        < 0.1%
```

---

## 7. How do you set an appropriate error threshold, and what actions would you take when the threshold is exceeded?

**🎯 Answer:**  
**Setting the threshold:**

- **📈 Analyze historical error rates** (e.g., 0.5% baseline).
- **📊 Define severity levels** (1% warning, 5% critical).

**Actions when exceeded:**

- **🚨 Alert the team** (Slack, PagerDuty).
- **🔄 Auto-scale or roll back.**
- **🐞 Debug using logs & traces.**
- **🔌 Implement circuit breakers.**

---

## 8. How do you handle API failures in a frontend application, and what strategies can be used for graceful degradation?

**🔄 Answer:**  
**Handling API failures:**

- **🔄 Retry mechanism** (exponential backoff).
- **📂 Fallback data** (cached responses).
- **🙏 User-friendly error messages.**

**Graceful degradation strategies:**

- **⏳ Lazy loading** (skeleton screens).
- **✨ Partial rendering** (critical content first).
- **📴 Offline mode** (Service Workers).

---

## 9. When faced with multiple front-end issues, how would you prioritize which ones to address first?

**🔝 Answer:**  
Prioritize based on:

1. **🔥 Impact** (user experience vs. minor UI glitch).
2. **📊 Frequency** (how many users affected).
3. **⚠️ Severity** (crashes > visual bugs).
4. **💰 Business impact** (checkout flow vs. blog page).

---

## 10. Discuss the factors you would consider when prioritizing frontend tasks related to error resolution, performance optimization, and feature improvements.

**⚖️ Answer:**
