- 🧩 Problems: Depth, symmetry, path sum, etc.

### 1️⃣1️⃣ **📊 Graphs**
- 🖼️ Representation (adjacency list/matrix)
- 🚶 Traversal algorithms (BFS, DFS)
- 🛣️ Shortest path problems (Dijkstra's)

### 1️⃣2️⃣ **🗂️ Heap/Priority Queue**
- 🛠️ Implementation and applications
- 🧩 Problems: Top K elements, etc.

### 1️⃣3️⃣ **🚀 Advanced Topics (after mastering basics)**
- 🧠 Dynamic programming
- ↩️ Backtracking
- 🤑 Greedy algorithms

- 💻 Bit manipulation

## Practice Approach

1. **Start simple** with basic problems on each topic 🏁
2. **Use platforms like**:
   - 🟧 LeetCode (filter by easy problems)
   - 🟪 HackerRank
   - 🟦 CodeSignal
   - 🟨 Codewars
3. **Build from scratch** - implement data structures in JS 🛠️
4. **Analyze complexity** for each solution 📈
5. **Daily practice** - aim for 1-2 problems daily ⏰

## JavaScript-Specific Tips

- 🎯 Master array methods (map, filter, reduce, etc.)
- 🔄 Understand object vs. Map in JS
- ✍️ Learn efficient string manipulation
- 🔁 Practice recursion (essential for tree/graph problems)
