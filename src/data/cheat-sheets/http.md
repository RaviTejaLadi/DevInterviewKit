| Encryption | No | Yes (TLS/SSL) |
| Port | 80 | 443 |
| Security | Vulnerable to MITM | Encrypted |
| SEO | Lower ranking | Higher ranking |

### **Common Content Types (MIME)**
| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `text/html` | HTML content |
| `application/json` | JSON data |

### **Quick Tips**
1. **Idempotent**: Repeated requests have the same effect (e.g., GET, PUT, DELETE).  
2. **Safe**: Doesn’t modify server state (e.g., GET, HEAD).  
3. Use `POST` for creation, `PUT` for full updates, `PATCH` for partial updates.  
4. Always sanitize inputs to prevent SQLi/XSS.  
5. Prefer HTTPS over HTTP for security.
