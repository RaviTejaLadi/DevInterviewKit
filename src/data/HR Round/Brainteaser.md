### 1. How many golf balls can fit in a school bus?

**Tips to Answer:**
- Think out loud and show your reasoning
- Break the problem into smaller parts
- Make reasonable assumptions
- It's about your thought process, not the exact answer

**Sample Answer:**
"Let me think through this step by step. First, I need to estimate the size of a school bus - let's say it's about 35 feet long, 8 feet wide, and 7 feet high, giving us roughly 2000 cubic feet of space. A golf ball has a diameter of about 1.7 inches, so its volume is roughly 2.5 cubic inches. However, spheres don't pack perfectly, so I'll assume about 60% packing efficiency. Converting units: 2000 cubic feet equals about 3.5 million cubic inches. With 60% efficiency, that's about 2.1 million cubic inches of usable space. Dividing by 2.5 cubic inches per ball gives us roughly 840,000 golf balls."

### 2. Why are manhole covers round?

**Tips to Answer:**
- Think about practical reasons
- Consider multiple possibilities
- Show logical thinking
- Explain your reasoning clearly

**Sample Answer:**
"Manhole covers are round for several practical reasons. First, a round cover can't fall through the hole no matter how you turn it, unlike a square cover which could fall diagonally. Second, round covers are easier to move because you can roll them instead of lifting and carrying them. Third, round shapes distribute weight evenly, making them stronger under pressure from vehicles. Finally, circular holes are easier to dig and maintain than other shapes."

### 3. How would you test a pen?

**Tips to Answer:**
- Think like a QA tester
- Consider different scenarios and users
- Include both functional and non-functional testing
- Be systematic in your approach

**Sample Answer:**
"I'd test a pen from multiple angles. **Functional testing:** Does it write smoothly on different paper types? How long does the ink last? Does it work at different angles? **Usability testing:** Is it comfortable to hold? Does the cap fit securely? **Durability testing:** What happens if you drop it? Does it work in extreme temperatures? **Performance testing:** How does it perform after long writing sessions? I'd also test edge cases like writing on wet paper or after the pen has been unused for weeks."

### 4. How many windows are there in your city?

**Tips to Answer:**
- Break down into categories (residential, commercial, etc.)
- Make reasonable estimates
- Show your calculation process
- Acknowledge assumptions and uncertainties

**Sample Answer:**
"Let me estimate for a city of about 500,000 people. I'll break this into categories: **Residential:** Assuming 200,000 homes with an average of 15 windows each = 3 million windows. **Commercial buildings:** About 5,000 businesses with an average of 50 windows each = 250,000 windows. **High-rise buildings:** Maybe 100 tall buildings with 1,000 windows each = 100,000 windows. **Cars:** 300,000 cars with 6 windows each = 1.8 million windows. Adding these up gives roughly 5.15 million windows. This is a rough estimate with many assumptions, but it gives us an order of magnitude."

### 5. If you could remove one state from the country, which would it be and why?

**Tips to Answer:**
- Be diplomatic and avoid controversial topics
- Focus on logical/practical reasoning
- Consider geographic or economic factors
- Avoid personal or political opinions

**Sample Answer:**
"This is a challenging question because every state has value and contributes to the country. If I had to approach this purely from a logistical perspective, I might consider geographic isolation and integration challenges. However, I'd rather focus on how to better connect and support all states instead of removing any. Each state has unique resources, culture, and people that contribute to the nation's diversity and strength."
