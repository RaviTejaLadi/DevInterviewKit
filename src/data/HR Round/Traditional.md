### 1. Tell me about yourself

**Tips to Answer:**
- Keep it professional and relevant to the job
- Follow the Present-Past-Future format
- Focus on your skills, experience, and career goals
- Keep it between 1-2 minutes

**Sample Answer:**
"I'm a software developer with 3 years of experience in web development. Currently, I work as a full-stack developer where I build applications using React, Node.js, and MongoDB. I've successfully delivered 5+ projects and led a team of 3 developers. In the past, I completed my computer science degree and worked on various personal projects that helped me learn different technologies. Looking forward, I want to grow into a senior developer role where I can mentor others and work on more challenging projects that make a real impact."

### 2. Why do you want to work here?

**Tips to Answer:**
- Research the company beforehand
- Mention specific things you like about the company
- Connect your goals with company values
- Show genuine interest

**Sample Answer:**
"I'm excited about this opportunity because your company is known for innovation in the fintech space. I've followed your recent product launches and I'm impressed by how you're solving real problems for small businesses. The collaborative culture and focus on continuous learning align perfectly with my values. I believe my experience in building secure web applications would contribute well to your team's goals."

### 3. What are your strengths?

**Tips to Answer:**
- Choose strengths relevant to the job
- Provide specific examples
- Show how your strengths benefit the team
- Be confident but not arrogant

**Sample Answer:**
"My main strength is problem-solving. I enjoy breaking down complex issues into smaller parts and finding creative solutions. For example, in my last project, we had a performance issue that was slowing down our application. I analyzed the code, identified the bottleneck in our database queries, and optimized them, which improved load time by 40%. I also collaborate well with others and often help teammates when they're stuck on technical challenges."

### 4. What are your weaknesses?

**Tips to Answer:**
- Choose a real weakness, not a disguised strength
- Show how you're working to improve it
- Keep it professional
- Don't mention critical job skills as weaknesses

**Sample Answer:**
"I sometimes spend too much time perfecting my code instead of moving forward with the project. I've learned that sometimes 'good enough' is better than perfect, especially when working with tight deadlines. To improve this, I now set time limits for myself on each task and ask for feedback from my team lead regularly to make sure I'm on the right track."

### 5. Where do you see yourself in 5 years?

**Tips to Answer:**
- Show ambition but be realistic
- Align with company growth opportunities
- Focus on skills and responsibilities, not just titles
- Show commitment to growth

**Sample Answer:**
"In 5 years, I see myself as a senior developer with deep expertise in my technical stack and strong leadership skills. I'd like to be mentoring junior developers and leading important projects. I'm also interested in learning more about system architecture and potentially moving into a technical lead role. I believe this position would give me the experience and challenges I need to reach these goals."
