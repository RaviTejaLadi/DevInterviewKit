### 1. What makes a good developer?

**Tips to Answer:**

- Balance technical and soft skills
- Give specific examples
- Show understanding of teamwork
- Mention continuous learning

**Sample Answer:** "A good developer needs strong technical skills, but that's
just the foundation. They should be curious and always learning because
technology changes fast. Good communication is crucial - you need to explain
complex problems simply and work well with others. Problem-solving skills are
essential, and so is attention to detail. Most importantly, a good developer
should write clean, maintainable code and think about how their work affects
users and teammates."

### 2. How do you handle stress and pressure?

**Tips to Answer:**

- Show you can work under pressure
- Mention specific strategies you use
- Give examples from your experience
- Stay positive and solution-focused

**Sample Answer:** "I actually work well under pressure because it helps me
focus on what's most important. When things get stressful, I first prioritize
tasks based on impact and urgency. I break big problems into smaller steps and
tackle them one by one. I also communicate regularly with my team about progress
and any roadblocks. For example, during a critical system outage, I stayed calm,
followed our incident response plan, and kept stakeholders updated every 30
minutes until we resolved the issue."

### 3. What's your opinion on code reviews?

**Tips to Answer:**

- Show you value quality and collaboration
- Mention both giving and receiving feedback
- Discuss the benefits for the team
- Show professionalism in handling criticism

**Sample Answer:** "Code reviews are essential for maintaining code quality and
sharing knowledge across the team. They help catch bugs early, ensure
consistency, and help everyone learn from each other. When reviewing others'
code, I focus on being constructive and explaining the 'why' behind my
suggestions. When receiving feedback, I see it as a learning opportunity. Code
reviews have helped me become a better developer and have improved our team's
overall code quality significantly."

### 4. How do you stay updated with new technologies?

**Tips to Answer:**

- Show you're committed to continuous learning
- Mention specific resources and methods
- Balance staying current with mastering fundamentals
- Connect learning to practical application

**Sample Answer:** "I follow several tech blogs and newsletters like GitHub's
newsletter and Stack Overflow's blog. I spend about 30 minutes each day reading
about new developments in my field. I also participate in online communities,
attend local meetups, and take online courses for deeper learning. However, I'm
careful not to chase every new trend - I focus on technologies that solve real
problems or can improve my current work. I also practice new skills through side
projects before applying them at work."

### 5. What do you think about working remotely vs in-office?

**Tips to Answer:**

- Be balanced and flexible
- Consider the company's work style
- Mention pros and cons of both
- Show you can adapt to either

**Sample Answer:** "Both have their advantages. Remote work offers flexibility
and fewer distractions, which can boost productivity for focused tasks like
coding. It also saves commute time. However, in-office work is great for
collaboration, quick discussions, and building team relationships. I think the
ideal situation depends on the project and team needs. I'm comfortable and
productive in both environments and believe good communication and clear
expectations are key to success regardless of the setup."
