### 1. Tell me about a time when you faced a difficult problem at work

**Tips to Answer:**
- Use the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result)
- Choose a real example with a positive outcome
- Focus on your actions and decision-making
- Show problem-solving skills

**Sample Answer:**
"**Situation:** In my previous job, our main application crashed right before a major client demo. **Task:** I needed to fix the issue quickly without affecting other parts of the system. **Action:** I first identified the error logs, found that a recent update caused a memory leak, rolled back the problematic code, and implemented a quick fix. I also communicated with the sales team about the delay. **Result:** We fixed the issue in 2 hours, successfully completed the demo, and the client signed the contract. I also created a better testing process to prevent similar issues."

### 2. Describe a time when you had to learn something new quickly

**Tips to Answer:**
- Show your learning ability and adaptability
- Explain your learning process
- Mention resources you used
- Highlight the positive outcome

**Sample Answer:**
"**Situation:** My team was assigned a project that required using Python, but I only knew JavaScript. **Task:** I had to become productive in Python within 2 weeks. **Action:** I dedicated 2 hours daily after work to learn Python basics, completed online tutorials, practiced coding challenges, and asked a Python-experienced colleague for guidance. **Result:** I successfully contributed to the project and even found a more efficient way to handle data processing. Now Python is one of my go-to languages for data-related tasks."

### 3. Tell me about a time you disagreed with your manager

**Tips to Answer:**
- Show respect for authority while standing your ground
- Focus on facts and business impact
- Demonstrate good communication skills
- End with a positive resolution

**Sample Answer:**
"**Situation:** My manager wanted to rush a feature release without proper testing. **Task:** I needed to express my concerns professionally. **Action:** I scheduled a private meeting and presented data showing that similar rushed releases led to 3x more bugs. I suggested a compromise - releasing core features first with additional testing, then adding advanced features later. **Result:** My manager appreciated the data-driven approach, we followed my suggestion, and the release was our most stable one that quarter."

### 4. Describe a time when you had to work with a difficult team member

**Tips to Answer:**
- Stay professional and avoid personal attacks
- Focus on behaviors, not personality
- Show your conflict resolution skills
- Highlight teamwork and collaboration

**Sample Answer:**
"**Situation:** I worked with a colleague who often criticized others' code publicly in meetings. **Task:** I needed to address this to maintain team morale. **Action:** I spoke with them privately, explained how their approach affected the team, and suggested giving feedback privately first, then discussing improvements in team meetings constructively. **Result:** They adjusted their approach, team communication improved, and we actually became good collaborators on future projects."

### 5. Tell me about your biggest failure and what you learned

**Tips to Answer:**
- Choose a real failure, not a disguised success
- Take responsibility for your part
- Focus on lessons learned and improvements made
- Show growth and maturity

**Sample Answer:**
"**Situation:** In my first job, I missed a critical bug that made it to production and affected 1000+ users. **Task:** I had to fix it immediately and understand why it happened. **Action:** I worked through the night to fix the issue, analyzed my testing process, and realized I hadn't tested edge cases properly. **Result:** I learned to create more thorough test cases and now I'm known for catching bugs early. This experience taught me the importance of systematic testing and taking responsibility for my work."
