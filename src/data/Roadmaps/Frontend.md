involves crafting visually appealing, interactive, and responsive interfaces
that provide seamless user experiences across different devices and platforms.

### Key Characteristics:

- Visual design implementation and user interface creation
- Interactive elements and user experience optimization
- Cross-browser compatibility and responsive design
- Performance optimization for fast loading times
- Accessibility ensuring inclusive user experiences

### Use Cases:

- Building websites, web applications, and mobile web apps
- Creating e-commerce platforms, social media interfaces, and dashboards
- Developing progressive web apps (PWAs) and single-page applications (SPAs)
- Implementing landing pages, portfolios, and corporate websites

### Prerequisites:

- Basic computer literacy and familiarity with web browsers
- Understanding of how the internet works (HTTP, URLs, domains)
- Problem-solving mindset and attention to detail
- Patience for debugging and continuous learning
- Basic design principles awareness (helpful but not mandatory)
