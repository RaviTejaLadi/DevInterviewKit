## 🔍 Definition

A **mixin** is a reusable object or function that lets you **copy properties and
methods** from one object to another. It helps achieve **multiple inheritance**
without class-based constraints.

---

## 🎯 Why Is It Important?

JavaScript does **not support multiple inheritance** (a class can’t extend more
than one class). Mixins offer a flexible way to **combine behaviors** from
multiple sources into one object or class.

---

## 🧱 Syntax / Structure

```javascript
Object.assign(target, source);
```

Or using a function:

```javascript
const myMixin = {
  greet() {
    console.log('Hello from mixin!');
  },
};

Object.assign(SomeClass.prototype, myMixin);
```

---

## 🧪 Examples

### ✨ Basic Example

```javascript
const canEat = {
  eat() {
    console.log('Eating...');
  },
};

const canWalk = {
  walk() {
    console.log('Walking...');
  },
};

const person = {};
Object.assign(person, canEat, canWalk);

person.eat(); // Eating...
person.walk(); // Walking...
```

---

### 🛠️ Real-World Use Case

Imagine you're building a **game** where characters can have various abilities.

```javascript
const canFly = {
  fly() {
    console.log(`${this.name} is flying!`);
  },
};

const canShoot = {
  shoot() {
    console.log(`${this.name} is shooting!`);
  },
};

function Hero(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

// Add abilities via mixins
Object.assign(Hero.prototype, canFly, canShoot);

const ironMan = new Hero('Iron Man');
ironMan.fly(); // Iron Man is flying!
ironMan.shoot(); // Iron Man is shooting!
```

---

## 🚀 When / Where to Use It

- When you need **code reuse** without using inheritance.
- When objects or classes need **shared behavior**.
- Great for **traits** like logging, event handling, or abilities in games.

## ⚠️ Gotchas / Tips

✅ **Tip:** Mixins are best for simple, reusable behaviors. ⚠️ **Gotcha:**
Property/method name clashes can **overwrite** existing properties. ✅ **Tip:**
Use mixins with care in large systems to **avoid ambiguity**. ⚠️ **Gotcha:**
Avoid using mixins that have **dependencies on each other**—they should be
modular.
