## 🔍 Definition

**Polymorphism** means **many forms**. In JavaScript, it allows different
objects to respond to the same method in different ways.

---

## 🎯 Why is it Important?

Polymorphism makes your code **flexible**, **extensible**, and **easier to
maintain**. It allows you to use the same interface for different data types or
classes, improving reusability and scalability.

---

## 🧱 Syntax/Structure

You can achieve polymorphism using **inheritance** and **method overriding**:

```javascript
class Animal {
  speak() {
    console.log('Animal speaks');
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  speak() {
    console.log('Dog barks');
  }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
  speak() {
    console.log('Cat meows');
  }
}

function makeItSpeak(animal) {
  animal.speak(); // Calls the overridden method
}
```

---

## 💡 Examples

### 📌 Basic Example

```javascript
class Bird {
  makeSound() {
    console.log('Chirp');
  }
}

class Parrot extends Bird {
  makeSound() {
    console.log('Squawk');
  }
}

const b1 = new Bird();
const p1 = new Parrot();

b1.makeSound(); // Chirp
p1.makeSound(); // Squawk
```

🔁 Both classes have a method `makeSound()` but behave differently. That’s
polymorphism!

---

### 🌍 Real-World Use Case

Imagine a payment system:

```javascript
class Payment {
  pay(amount) {
    console.log(`Paying $${amount}`);
  }
}

class CreditCard extends Payment {
  pay(amount) {
    console.log(`Paying $${amount} with Credit Card`);
  }
}

class PayPal extends Payment {
  pay(amount) {
    console.log(`Paying $${amount} using PayPal`);
  }
}

function processPayment(paymentMethod) {
  paymentMethod.pay(100);
}

processPayment(new CreditCard()); // Paying $100 with Credit Card
processPayment(new PayPal()); // Paying $100 using PayPal
```

✔️ `processPayment()` works with any payment method — that’s the power of
polymorphism.

---

## 🧰 When/Where to Use It

Use polymorphism when:

- You have **related objects** that share behavior but differ in implementation.
- You want to write **cleaner, DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** code.
- You're building **scalable systems** like plugins, payment processors, or UI
  components.

---

## ⚠️ Gotchas/Tips

✅ **Best Practices**:

- Use polymorphism with a clear class hierarchy.
- Keep method names consistent across subclasses.

⚠️ **Common Mistakes**:

- Forgetting to override methods.
- Not calling superclass methods (if needed) using `super.methodName()`.

---

🧠 **Wrap-Up**: Polymorphism lets objects behave differently under a shared
interface. It’s like giving each object its own personality while speaking the
same language. 🎭
