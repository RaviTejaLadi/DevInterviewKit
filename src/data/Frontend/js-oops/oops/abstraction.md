## 🔍 Definition

**Abstraction** is the concept of hiding complex implementation details and
showing only the essential features of an object or function.

---

## 🎯 Why is it Important?

Abstraction makes code **simpler to use**, **easier to maintain**, and **less
error-prone** by focusing on _what_ an object does rather than _how_ it does it.

---

## 🛠️ Syntax / Structure

There’s no built-in keyword for abstraction in JavaScript, but it’s achieved
using:

- **Functions**
- **Objects/Classes**
- **Private properties or methods** (using `#` or closures)

```javascript
class Car {
  #startEngine() {
    console.log('Engine started');
  }

  drive() {
    this.#startEngine(); // Abstracted internal logic
    console.log('Car is driving');
  }
}
```

---

## 💡 Examples

### 🔹 Basic Example

```javascript
function greetUser(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

// Caller doesn't need to know how greeting is constructed
console.log(greetUser('Alice')); // Output: Hello, Alice!
```

### 🔸 Real-World Use Case

```javascript
class PaymentProcessor {
  #connectToGateway() {
    console.log('Connecting to payment gateway...');
  }

  processPayment(amount) {
    this.#connectToGateway();
    console.log(`Processing payment of $${amount}`);
  }
}

const payment = new PaymentProcessor();
payment.processPayment(100); // Only uses exposed method
```

Here, `#connectToGateway()` is hidden (abstracted) from the outside — you only
use `processPayment()`.

---

## 📌 When/Where to Use It

Use abstraction when:

- Hiding complex logic from users of your code.
- Creating reusable components or libraries.
- Working with APIs or services.
- Writing large-scale applications that require separation of concerns.

---

## ⚠️ Gotchas / Tips

✅ **Do**:

- Use abstraction to separate _interface_ from _implementation_.
- Keep interfaces clean and focused.

❌ **Avoid**:

- Over-abstraction (too many layers can confuse more than help).
- Exposing internal methods or data unnecessarily.

📝 **Tip**: Use private fields (`#fieldName`) or closures to hide implementation
details.
