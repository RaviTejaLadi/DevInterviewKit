## 📖 Definition

**Composition over inheritance** is a design principle that encourages building
objects by combining simple, reusable behaviors (functions/objects) rather than
using class hierarchies.

---

## 🎯 Why is it important?

It helps avoid deep and rigid inheritance trees, making code easier to reuse,
test, and maintain.

---

## 🧱 Syntax/Structure

You combine behaviors using functions or objects instead of extending classes:

```js
const canDrive = (state) => ({
  drive: () => console.log(`${state.name} is driving.`),
});

const canFly = (state) => ({
  fly: () => console.log(`${state.name} is flying.`),
});

const createSuperHero = (name) => {
  const state = { name };
  return Object.assign({}, canDrive(state), canFly(state));
};
```

---

## 💡 Examples

### 🧪 Basic Example

```js
const canBark = (state) => ({
  bark: () => console.log(`${state.name} says: Woof!`),
});

const canWagTail = (state) => ({
  wag: () => console.log(`${state.name} is wagging its tail.`),
});

const createDog = (name) => {
  const state = { name };
  return Object.assign({}, canBark(state), canWagTail(state));
};

const dog = createDog('Buddy');
dog.bark(); // Buddy says: Woof!
dog.wag(); // Buddy is wagging its tail.
```

---

### 🌍 Real-World Use Case

Imagine building a game where characters have different abilities:

```js
const canShoot = (state) => ({
  shoot: () => console.log(`${state.name} fires a blaster!`),
});

const canJump = (state) => ({
  jump: () => console.log(`${state.name} jumps high!`),
});

const createPlayer = (name) => {
  const state = { name };
  return Object.assign({}, canShoot(state), canJump(state));
};

const player = createPlayer('Space Ranger');
player.shoot(); // Space Ranger fires a blaster!
player.jump(); // Space Ranger jumps high!
```

Here, you can mix and match abilities without using complex inheritance trees
like `Player -> Shooter -> Jumper`.

---

## 🛠️ When/Where to Use It

Use **composition** when:

- You want **flexibility** (e.g., mix only the behaviors needed).
- Avoiding **tight coupling** between classes is important.
- Your objects need **shared functionality** without forced hierarchy.
- You're building reusable code (like plugins or modules).

---

## ⚠️ Gotchas/Tips

- 🔁 **Avoid state conflicts**: When composing, ensure shared state keys don’t
  overwrite each other.
- 🧪 **Favor pure functions**: Keep your behavior modules stateless or isolate
  the state.
- 🧩 **Keep behaviors focused**: Small, single-responsibility functions work
  best.
- 🚫 **Don't overdo it**: Use composition when inheritance starts feeling too
  rigid or deep.
