# React.js Interview Questions

## Core React Concepts

### 1. What is the Virtual DOM and how does it work?

**Answer:**  
Virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the real DOM. When state changes, React:

1. Creates a new Virtual DOM
2. Compares it with previous one (diffing)
3. Updates only the changed parts in real DOM (reconciliation)
4. This makes updates efficient

**Remember:** Think of it like an architect's blueprint - you only rebuild the
changed parts of the house.

### 2. Explain React's component lifecycle in class components

**Answer:**  
Three main phases:

1. **Mounting:**  
   `constructor` → `render` → `componentDidMount`
2. **Updating:**  
   `shouldComponentUpdate` → `render` → `componentDidUpdate`
3. **Unmounting:**  
   `componentWillUnmount`

**Remember:** "Mount, Update, Unmount" - like a photo frame you put up, change,
then take down.

### 3. What are controlled vs uncontrolled components?

**Answer:**

- **Controlled:** Form data handled by React state (single source of truth)
- **Uncontrolled:** Form data handled by DOM itself (using refs)

**Remember:** Controlled = React drives, Uncontrolled = DOM drives

### 4. What is JSX and how does it work?

**Answer:**  
JSX is syntax sugar for `React.createElement()`. It:

1. Looks like HTML but is JavaScript
2. Gets transpiled to JavaScript
3. Allows writing components in familiar HTML-like syntax

**Remember:** JSX is like writing HTML that turns into JavaScript function
calls.

### 5. What are keys in React and why are they important?

**Answer:**  
Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or removed. They:

1. Must be unique among siblings
2. Help in efficient re-rendering
3. Should be stable (not random or indexes for dynamic lists)

**Remember:** Keys are like ID cards for list items - helps React recognize
them.

## Performance Optimization

### 6. How do you optimize React application performance?

**Answer:**  
Key techniques:

1. `React.memo` for component memoization
2. `useMemo`/`useCallback` for expensive calculations/functions
3. Code splitting with `React.lazy`
4. Virtualization for long lists
5. Avoid inline function definitions in render

**Remember:** "Memoize, Split, Virtualize" - the performance mantra.

### 7. When should you use useMemo and useCallback?

**Answer:**

- `useMemo`: Cache expensive calculations between re-renders
- `useCallback`: Cache function references between re-renders

Use when:

- Passing callbacks to optimized child components
- Calculations are computationally heavy
- Dependencies haven't changed

**Remember:** `useMemo` for values, `useCallback` for functions.

### 8. What is code splitting and how do you implement it in React?

**Answer:**  
Splitting code into smaller chunks loaded on demand:

```jsx
const OtherComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./OtherComponent'));
```

Use with `Suspense` for fallback UI.

**Remember:** Like chapters in a book - load only what you need when you need
it.

### 9. How does React Fiber improve performance?

**Answer:**  
Fiber is React's new reconciliation engine that:

1. Enables incremental rendering
2. Can pause/prioritize work
3. Splits rendering into chunks
4. Enables features like concurrent mode

**Remember:** Fiber makes React work like a smart scheduler rather than a
blocking worker.

### 10. What are pure components and when should you use them?

**Answer:**  
`PureComponent` (class) or `React.memo` (function) only re-render when
props/state change. Use when:

- Component renders often with same props
- Rendering is expensive
- Props are primitive values (not complex objects)

**Remember:** Pure components are like calculators - only recalculate when
inputs change.

## State Management

### 11. What are the differences between Redux and Context API?

**Answer:**

- **Redux:**
  - Single global store
  - Middleware support
  - DevTools
  - Predictable state updates
- **Context API:**
  - Built into React
  - Simpler for small apps
  - No middleware
  - Can trigger unnecessary re-renders

**Remember:** Redux is a full toolkit, Context is a pocket knife.

### 12. When would you choose Redux over React's built-in state management?

**Answer:**  
Choose Redux when:

- App state is complex
- State needs to be shared across many components
- You need state persistence/time-travel debugging
- Multiple reducers needed for different state slices

**Remember:** Redux shines in large apps with complex state interactions.

### 13. What is the Flux pattern?

**Answer:**  
Unidirectional data flow pattern:

1. **Actions** describe events
2. **Dispatcher** sends actions to stores
3. **Stores** hold state and update it
4. **Views** re-render when stores change

**Remember:** Data flows one way: Action → Dispatcher → Store → View → Action...

### 14. How would you implement global state without Redux?

**Answer:**  
Options:

1. Context API + `useReducer`
2. Zustand/Jotai (simpler alternatives)
3. Lift state up to common ancestor
4. Event emitters

**Remember:** Modern React can handle global state without Redux for many cases.

### 15. What are the common pitfalls with React state management?

**Answer:**

1. Overusing Context causing unnecessary re-renders
2. Mutating state directly
3. Storing derived state instead of computing it
4. Not colocating state (keeping state too global)
5. Over-engineering with Redux for simple cases

**Remember:** "Right state, right place" - keep state as local as possible.

## Advanced Patterns

### 16. What are Higher-Order Components (HOCs) and when would you use them?

**Answer:**  
HOCs are functions that take a component and return a new enhanced component.
Use them for:

- Code reuse across components
- Props manipulation
- State abstraction
- Render hijacking

**Remember:** HOCs are like component wrappers that add superpowers.

### 17. What is the Render Props pattern?

**Answer:**  
A pattern where a component's children is a function that receives values:

```jsx
<DataProvider render={(data) => <Child data={data} />} />
```

Alternative to HOCs for sharing logic.

**Remember:** "Render props" means passing a function as props to control
rendering.

### 18. What are Compound Components?

**Answer:**  
Components that work together sharing implicit state:

```jsx
<Tabs>
  <TabList>...</TabList>
  <TabPanels>...</TabPanels>
</Tabs>
```

Like HTML `<select>` and `<option>`.

**Remember:** Compound components are like LEGO blocks designed to fit together.

### 19. What is the Provider Pattern in React?

**Answer:**  
A component that provides data to its descendants via Context:

```jsx
<ThemeProvider value="dark">
  <App />
</ThemeProvider>
```

Children access via `useContext`.

**Remember:** Provider is like a broadcasting station for data.

### 20. When would you use the Observer Pattern in React?

**Answer:**  
Use when components need to react to changes outside React's flow:

- WebSocket updates
- External store changes
- Browser events Implemented via:
- Custom events
- RxJS
- MobX

**Remember:** Observer pattern connects React to the outside world.

## React Ecosystem

### 21. How does Next.js differ from Create React App?

**Answer:**

- **Next.js:**
  - Server-side rendering
  - File-based routing
  - API routes
  - Built-in optimizations
- **CRA:**
  - Client-side only
  - Needs react-router
  - Pure SPA

**Remember:** Next.js is for SSR/SSG, CRA is for pure client-side SPAs.

### 22. What problems does React Router solve?

**Answer:**

- Client-side routing without page reloads
- Nested route configuration
- URL parameter handling
- Route-based code splitting

**Remember:** React Router makes your SPA feel like a multi-page app.

### 23. When would you choose GraphQL with React over REST?

**Answer:**  
Choose GraphQL when:

- You need to reduce over-fetching
- Frontend needs flexible data requirements
- Multiple data sources need aggregation
- Real-time updates via subscriptions

**Remember:** GraphQL gives frontend control over data requirements.

### 24. What are React Server Components?

**Answer:**  
Components that render on the server:

- Zero bundle size
- Direct database access
- Automatic code splitting
- Still in experimental phase

**Remember:** Server Components = less JS sent to client.

### 25. How would you implement internationalization in React?

**Answer:**  
Options:

1. `react-i18next` (i18next integration)
2. FormatJS (React Intl)
3. Custom context-based solution Key concepts:

- Translation files
- Locale detection
- Pluralization rules
- Date/number formatting

**Remember:** i18n = prepare your app for multiple languages.

## Testing

### 26. What testing strategies do you use for React apps?

**Answer:**

1. **Unit Tests:** Jest + React Testing Library for components
2. **Integration Tests:** Testing component interactions
3. **E2E Tests:** Cypress/Playwright for user flows
4. **Snapshot Tests:** For unexpected UI changes

**Remember:** Test behavior, not implementation details.

### 27. What's the difference between Jest and React Testing Library?

**Answer:**

- **Jest:** Test runner with assertion library
- **RTL:** Light utility for testing React components They complement each
  other:
- Jest runs tests and makes assertions
- RTL provides React-specific querying

**Remember:** Jest is the engine, RTL is the steering wheel.

### 28. How do you test custom hooks?

**Answer:**

1. Use `@testing-library/react-hooks`
2. Render hook in test component
3. Test return values and interactions Key considerations:

- Handle async hooks
- Test hook dependencies
- Cleanup effects

**Remember:** Test hooks like mini-components.

### 29. What are some common testing anti-patterns in React?

**Answer:**

1. Testing implementation details
2. Overusing snapshot tests
3. Not mocking external dependencies
4. Testing multiple things in one test
5. Not testing error states

**Remember:** Test what matters to users, not internal workings.

### 30. How would you test a component connected to Redux?

**Answer:**

1. Wrap in `<Provider>` with test store
2. Mock selectors/actions if needed
3. Test connected and unconnected versions
4. Use `redux-mock-store` for action testing

**Remember:** Isolate Redux logic from presentation.

**Answer:**  
Feature-based structure:

```
/src
  /features
    /user
      /components
      /hooks
      /store
      /api
  /shared
    /components
    /utils
    /styles
```

Key principles:

- Colocation

### 33. How do you handle authentication in React apps?

**Answer:**  
Common approach:

1. Auth provider (Context/Redux)
2. Protected routes
3. Token management
4. Refresh token flow
5. Error handling

Libraries:

- Auth0
- Firebase Auth
- Custom JWT implementation

**Remember:** Auth = state + routes + token management.

### 34. What strategies would you use for error handling?

**Answer:**

1. Error boundaries for UI errors
2. Global error handler
3. API error normalization
4. Error logging (Sentry, etc.)
5. Fallback UIs

**Remember:** Plan for errors at multiple levels.

### 35. How would you implement feature flags in React?

**Answer:**

1. Context/Redux for flag state
2. Environment-based flags
3. API-driven flags
4. Wrapper components

```jsx
<FeatureFlag name="new-ui">
  <NewComponent />
</FeatureFlag>
```

**Remember:** Feature flags = controlled rollout.

## Hooks

### 36. How do hooks work under the hood?

**Answer:**  
Hooks:

1. Rely on call order (must be unconditional)
2. Use a "dispatcher" during rendering
3. Store state in a linked list
4. Have rules to maintain consistency

**Remember:** Hooks are like a queue - order matters.

### 37. When would you create a custom hook?

**Answer:**  
When you need to:

1. Reuse stateful logic
2. Abstract complex effects
3. Share logic between components
4. Create domain-specific utilities

**Remember:** Custom hooks = reusable behavior without components.

### 38. What's the difference between useEffect and useLayoutEffect?

**Answer:**

- `useEffect`: Async, after paint
- `useLayoutEffect`: Sync, before paint Use `useLayoutEffect` when you need to:
- Measure DOM
- Synchronously re-render

**Remember:** `useLayoutEffect` = "I need this NOW".

### 39. How would you handle data fetching with hooks?

**Answer:**  
Common patterns:

1. `useEffect` + state
2. Custom `useFetch` hook
3. Library (React Query, SWR) Key considerations:

- Loading/error states
- Cancellation
- Dependency management

**Remember:** Fetching = state + effects + cleanup.

### 40. What are some common hook pitfalls?

**Answer:**

1. Missing dependencies
2. Infinite loops
3. Stale closures
4. Conditional hooks
5. Overusing hooks for simple cases

**Remember:** Follow the Rules of Hooks religiously.

## React Internals

### 41. How does React's reconciliation algorithm work?

**Answer:**  
React:

1. Compares element types
2. Updates only changed DOM nodes
3. Keys help identify elements
4. Uses heuristic O(n) algorithm

**Remember:** Reconciliation = smart diffing for the DOM.

### 42. What is the significance of keys in reconciliation?

**Answer:**  
Keys help React:

1. Identify elements between renders
2. Reorder instead of recreate
3. Preserve state
4. Optimize updates

**Remember:** Good keys = efficient updates.

### 43. How does React handle events differently from DOM?

**Answer:**  
React:

1. Uses synthetic events
2. Pools event objects
3. Handles delegation at root
4. Normalizes browser differences

**Remember:** Synthetic events = cross-browser consistency.

### 44. What is Concurrent Mode in React?

**Answer:**  
New rendering mechanism that:

1. Enables interruptible rendering
2. Prioritizes updates
3. Pre-renders in background
4. Reduces jank

**Remember:** Concurrent Mode = smoother UX.

### 45. How does React's fiber architecture work?

**Answer:**  
Fiber:

1. Breaks work into chunks
2. Can pause/resume work
3. Assigns priority to updates
4. Enables features like Suspense

**Remember:** Fiber = React's new rendering engine.
