## Basic CSS Questions

### 1. What is CSS?
**Answer:** CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. It controls how elements are displayed on screen, in print, or other media.

### 2. What are the different ways to include CSS in a webpage?
**Answer:**
- Inline CSS (using the style attribute)
- Internal CSS (using `<style>` tag in the head section)
- External CSS (using a separate `.css` file linked via `<link>` tag)

### 3. What is the CSS box model?
**Answer:** The CSS box model describes the rectangular boxes generated for elements, consisting of:
- Content (actual content of the box)
- Padding (space between content and border)
- Border (edge around padding)
- Margin (space outside the border)

### 4. What is the difference between padding and margin?
**Answer:** 
- Padding is the space between the content and the border (inside the element)
- Margin is the space outside the border (between elements)

### 5. What are CSS selectors?
**Answer:** CSS selectors are patterns used to select the element(s) you want to style. Common selectors include:
- Element selector (`p`)
- Class selector (`.class`)
- ID selector (`#id`)
- Attribute selector (`[type="text"]`)
- Pseudo-class selector (`:hover`)

## Intermediate CSS Questions

### 6. What is the difference between display: none and visibility: hidden?
**Answer:**
- `display: none` removes the element from the document flow (doesn't take up space)
- `visibility: hidden` hides the element but it still takes up space in the layout

### 7. What is the difference between inline, inline-block, and block?
**Answer:**
- **Inline**: Elements don't start on a new line and only take up necessary width (e.g., `<span>`)
- **Block**: Elements start on a new line and take up full width (e.g., `<div>`)
- **Inline-block**: Like inline but can have width/height set (hybrid of both)

### 8. What is the z-index in CSS?
**Answer:** The z-index property specifies the stack order of elements (which appears in front). Higher z-index values appear in front of lower ones. It only works on positioned elements (position: absolute, relative, fixed, or sticky).

### 9. What is the difference between position: relative, absolute, fixed, and sticky?
**Answer:**
- **relative**: Positioned relative to its normal position
- **absolute**: Positioned relative to its nearest positioned ancestor
- **fixed**: Positioned relative to the viewport (doesn't move when scrolling)
- **sticky**: Toggles between relative and fixed based on scroll position

### 10. What are CSS pseudo-elements and pseudo-classes?
**Answer:**
- **Pseudo-classes** (`:hover`, `:active`, `:first-child`) style elements in a specific state
- **Pseudo-elements** (`::before`, `::after`, `::first-line`) style specific parts of an element

## Advanced CSS Questions

### 11. What is CSS specificity and how does it work?
**Answer:** CSS specificity determines which styles are applied when multiple rules target the same element. It's calculated based on:
- Inline styles (1000)
- IDs (100)
- Classes/attributes/pseudo-classes (10)
- Elements/pseudo-elements (1)

### 12. What is the difference between em and rem units?
**Answer:**
- `em` is relative to the font-size of its direct or nearest parent
- `rem` is relative to the font-size of the root (html) element

### 13. What are CSS variables and how do you use them?
**Answer:** CSS variables (custom properties) are defined with `--` prefix and accessed with `var()`:
```css
:root {
  --main-color: #06c;
}
.element {
  color: var(--main-color);
}
```

### 14. What is the difference between flexbox and CSS grid?
**Answer:**
- **Flexbox**: One-dimensional layout (either row or column)
- **Grid**: Two-dimensional layout (rows and columns simultaneously)

### 15. What are CSS preprocessors? Name some popular ones.
**Answer:** CSS preprocessors extend CSS with features like variables, nesting, and mixins. Popular ones include:
- Sass
- Less
- Stylus

## Layout and Responsive Design

### 16. How do you center a div horizontally and vertically?
**Answer:**
```css
/* Method 1: Flexbox */
.container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}

/* Method 2: Grid */
.container {
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
}

/* Method 3: Transform */
.element {
  position: absolute;
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%;
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
}
```

### 17. What is responsive web design?
**Answer:** Responsive web design is an approach where websites adapt to different screen sizes and devices using flexible layouts, media queries, and responsive images.

### 18. What are media queries?
**Answer:** Media queries allow you to apply CSS styles based on device characteristics (like screen width):
```css
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .element { display: none; }
}
```

### 19. What is mobile-first design?
**Answer:** Mobile-first design is an approach where you design for mobile devices first, then add enhancements for larger screens using min-width media queries.

### 20. What is the viewport meta tag?
**Answer:** The viewport meta tag controls layout on mobile browsers:
```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
```

## CSS3 Features

### 21. What are CSS transitions?
**Answer:** CSS transitions allow property changes to occur smoothly over a specified duration:
```css
.element {
  transition: property duration timing-function delay;
}
```

### 22. What are CSS animations?
**Answer:** CSS animations allow more complex animations using keyframes:
```css
@keyframes example {
  from {background-color: red;}
  to {background-color: yellow;}
}

.element {
  animation: example 4s;
}
```

### 23. What are CSS transforms?
**Answer:** CSS transforms modify the space around elements (rotate, scale, skew, translate):
```css
.element {
  transform: rotate(45deg) scale(1.5);
}
```

### 24. What is the difference between transition and animation?
**Answer:**
- Transitions need a trigger (like hover) and go from one state to another
- Animations can run automatically, have multiple keyframes, and more complex sequences

### 25. What are CSS filters?
**Answer:** CSS filters apply graphical effects like blur, brightness, contrast:
```css
.element {
  filter: blur(5px) grayscale(50%);
}
```

## Flexbox Questions

### 26. What is Flexbox?
**Answer:** Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout model that provides efficient ways to align and distribute space among items in a container.

### 27. What are the main properties of flex container?
**Answer:**
- `display: flex`
- `flex-direction`
- `flex-wrap`
- `justify-content`
- `align-items`
- `align-content`

### 28. What does flex: 1 mean?
**Answer:** `flex: 1` is shorthand for:
- `flex-grow: 1` (grow to fill available space)
- `flex-shrink: 1` (can shrink if needed)
- `flex-basis: 0` (initial size is 0)

### 29. What's the difference between justify-content and align-items?
**Answer:**
- `justify-content` aligns items along the main axis
- `align-items` aligns items along the cross axis

### 30. How do you change the direction of flex items?
**Answer:** Use `flex-direction` with values:
- `row` (default)
- `row-reverse`
- `column`
- `column-reverse`

## Grid Questions

### 31. What is CSS Grid?
**Answer:** CSS Grid is a two-dimensional layout system that handles both rows and columns.

### 32. What are the main properties of grid container?
**Answer:**
- `display: grid`
- `grid-template-columns`
- `grid-template-rows`
- `gap`
- `justify-items`
- `align-items`

### 33. What is the difference between grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr) and grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr?
**Answer:** They produce the same result, but `repeat()` is more concise, especially for larger grids.

### 34. What is the fr unit in CSS Grid?
**Answer:** The `fr` unit represents a fraction of the available space in the grid container.

### 35. How do you place items in specific grid areas?
**Answer:** Using `grid-area` on the item and defining areas in the container:
```css
.container {
  grid-template-areas: "header header" "sidebar main";
}
.header { grid-area: header; }
```

## Performance and Best Practices

### 36. How can you improve CSS performance?
**Answer:**
- Minify CSS files
- Use efficient selectors
- Avoid overly specific selectors
- Reduce use of expensive properties (like box-shadow)
- Use CSS sprites for multiple images
- Implement critical CSS for above-the-fold content

### 37. What is BEM methodology?
**Answer:** BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) is a naming convention:
- Block: standalone component (`menu`)
- Element: part of block (`menu__item`)
- Modifier: variant of block/element (`menu__item--active`)

### 38. What is critical CSS?
**Answer:** Critical CSS is the minimum CSS needed to render the above-the-fold content of a page, loaded inline in the head to improve perceived performance.

### 39. What are CSS sprites?
**Answer:** CSS sprites combine multiple images into one image to reduce HTTP requests, using background-position to display specific parts.

### 40. What is the difference between reset.css and normalize.css?
**Answer:**
- Reset.css removes all default browser styling
- Normalize.css makes default styles consistent across browsers while preserving useful defaults

## Browser Compatibility

### 41. What are CSS vendor prefixes?
**Answer:** Vendor prefixes are browser-specific prefixes for experimental or non-standard CSS properties:
- `-webkit-` (Chrome, Safari)
- `-moz-` (Firefox)
- `-ms-` (Internet Explorer)
- `-o-` (Opera)

### 42. What is feature queries in CSS?
**Answer:** Feature queries (`@supports`) check if a browser supports a CSS feature:
```css
@supports (display: grid) {
  .container { display: grid; }
}
```

### 43. What is graceful degradation vs progressive enhancement?
**Answer:**
- Graceful degradation: Build for modern browsers first, then provide fallbacks
- Progressive enhancement: Build basic experience first, then enhance for modern browsers

### 44. What are CSS hacks?
**Answer:** CSS hacks are techniques to target specific browsers with CSS, though they're generally discouraged in favor of feature detection.

### 45. How do you handle browser-specific styling issues?
**Answer:**
- Use feature detection
- Implement polyfills
- Use vendor prefixes
- Apply conditional comments (for IE)
- Use CSS reset or normalize

## Advanced Topics

### 46. What is the cascade in CSS?
**Answer:** The cascade determines which styles are applied when multiple rules could apply, based on:
- Importance (`!important`)
- Specificity
- Source order

### 47. What is stacking context in CSS?
**Answer:** Stacking context is the three-dimensional positioning of elements along the z-axis, created by properties like position, opacity, transform, etc.

### 48. What is the difference between CSS custom properties and preprocessor variables?
**Answer:**
- CSS variables are native, dynamic, and can be changed with JavaScript
- Preprocessor variables are compiled to static values and don't exist in the browser

### 49. What are CSS blend modes?
**Answer:** CSS blend modes control how elements blend with their background or other elements, similar to Photoshop blend modes.

### 50. What is the difference between will-change and translateZ(0)?
**Answer:**
- `will-change` hints to the browser what properties will change
- `translateZ(0)` forces hardware acceleration (hack)
- `will-change` is the modern, recommended approach
