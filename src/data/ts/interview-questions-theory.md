# Top 30 TypeScript Theory Questions for Interviews

## 1. What is TypeScript and how does it differ from JavaScript?
**Answer:** TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static type checking at compile time. It compiles to plain JavaScript and provides better tooling, error detection during development, and enhanced code maintainability compared to JavaScript's dynamic typing.

## 2. What are the primitive types in TypeScript?
**Answer:** The primitive types are: `string`, `number`, `boolean`, `null`, `undefined`, `symbol`, `bigint`, and `void`. TypeScript also has `any`, `unknown`, `never`, and `object` as additional built-in types.

## 3. What is the difference between `any` and `unknown` types?
**Answer:** `any` disables type checking completely, allowing any operation. `unknown` is type-safe and requires type checking before performing operations. `unknown` is the safer alternative to `any`.

## 4. Explain the difference between `interface` and `type` in TypeScript.
**Answer:** Both define object shapes, but `interface` supports declaration merging, inheritance with `extends`, and is ideal for object-oriented patterns. `type` supports union types, intersections, and computed properties, making it more flexible for complex type operations.

## 5. What are Union Types and Intersection Types?
**Answer:** Union types (`A | B`) allow a value to be one of several types. Intersection types (`A & B`) combine multiple types into one, requiring the value to satisfy all constituent types simultaneously.

## 6. What is Type Assertion and when should you use it?
**Answer:** Type assertion tells the compiler to treat a value as a specific type using `as` keyword or angle bracket syntax. Use it when you know more about a value's type than TypeScript can infer, but use sparingly as it bypasses type checking.

## 7. What are Generics in TypeScript and why are they useful?
**Answer:** Generics allow creating reusable components that work with multiple types while maintaining type safety. They use type parameters (`<T>`) to capture and preserve type information, enabling flexible yet type-safe code.

## 8. Explain the `never` type and provide use cases.
**Answer:** `never` represents values that never occur. It's used for functions that never return (infinite loops, always throw errors), exhaustive checks in switch statements, and represents unreachable code paths.

## 9. What is the difference between `let`, `const`, and `var` in TypeScript?
**Answer:** `var` is function-scoped and hoisted. `let` is block-scoped and not hoisted. `const` is block-scoped, not hoisted, and cannot be reassigned (though object contents can be modified).

## 10. What are Conditional Types in TypeScript?
**Answer:** Conditional types allow creating types based on conditions using the `T extends U ? X : Y` syntax. They enable sophisticated type transformations and are fundamental to advanced TypeScript patterns.

## 11. What is Type Inference and how does it work?
**Answer:** Type inference automatically determines types based on context without explicit type annotations. TypeScript analyzes assigned values, return statements, and usage patterns to infer the most appropriate types.

## 12. Explain Mapped Types with examples.
**Answer:** Mapped types create new types by transforming properties of existing types. Common examples include `Partial<T>`, `Required<T>`, `Readonly<T>`, and `Pick<T, K>`. They use the syntax `{ [K in keyof T]: ... }`.

## 13. What are Utility Types in TypeScript?
**Answer:** Utility types are built-in generic types that facilitate common type transformations: `Partial<T>`, `Required<T>`, `Readonly<T>`, `Pick<T, K>`, `Omit<T, K>`, `Record<K, T>`, `Exclude<T, U>`, `Extract<T, U>`, `ReturnType<T>`, etc.

## 14. What is the difference between `readonly` and `const`?
**Answer:** `const` prevents reassignment of variables. `readonly` prevents modification of object properties or array elements. `const` works on bindings, while `readonly` works on properties.

## 15. What are Index Signatures in TypeScript?
**Answer:** Index signatures define types for object properties when property names are not known in advance. Syntax: `{ [key: string]: valueType }`. They allow objects to have additional properties of specified types.

## 16. Explain the concept of Type Guards.
**Answer:** Type guards are runtime checks that narrow types within conditional blocks. They include `typeof`, `instanceof`, `in` operator, and custom type guard functions that return `value is Type`.

## 17. What are Abstract Classes and how do they differ from Interfaces?
**Answer:** Abstract classes can contain implementation details and cannot be instantiated directly. They can have abstract methods (must be implemented by subclasses) and concrete methods. Interfaces only define contracts without implementation.

## 18. What is the `keyof` operator and how is it used?
**Answer:** `keyof` creates a union type of all property names of a given type. It's used for type-safe property access, creating mapped types, and ensuring only valid property names are used.

## 19. Explain Function Overloading in TypeScript.
**Answer:** Function overloading allows defining multiple function signatures for the same function name with different parameter types or counts. The implementation must handle all overload cases.

## 20. What are Template Literal Types?
**Answer:** Template literal types use template literal syntax to create types based on string patterns. They enable precise string type definitions and are useful for creating APIs with specific string formats.

## 21. What is the difference between Structural and Nominal typing?
**Answer:** TypeScript uses structural typing (duck typing) where type compatibility is based on structure/shape rather than explicit declarations. Objects are compatible if they have the same properties, regardless of how they were declared.

## 22. What are Decorators in TypeScript?
**Answer:** Decorators are special functions that can be attached to classes, methods, properties, or parameters to modify their behavior or add metadata. They use the `@decorator` syntax and are experimental features.

## 23. Explain the `infer` keyword in Conditional Types.
**Answer:** `infer` allows extracting types from other types within conditional type expressions. It's used to capture and use parts of types being checked, enabling powerful type-level programming.

## 24. What is Type Narrowing and what techniques achieve it?
**Answer:** Type narrowing reduces union types to more specific types through runtime checks. Techniques include type guards, `typeof`, `instanceof`, truthiness checks, equality checks, and the `in` operator.

## 25. What are Module Declaration Merging and Namespace Merging?
**Answer:** Declaration merging allows multiple declarations with the same name to be combined into a single definition. Interface merging combines properties, while namespace merging combines exports.

## 26. What is the difference between `Array<T>` and `T[]` syntax?
**Answer:** Both represent arrays of type T and are functionally identical. `T[]` is shorthand syntax, while `Array<T>` is generic syntax. Choice is often stylistic, but `T[]` is more common for simple types.

## 27. What are Ambient Declarations and when are they used?
**Answer:** Ambient declarations describe types for JavaScript libraries or global variables without providing implementation. They use the `declare` keyword and are typically found in `.d.ts` files for type definitions.

## 28. Explain the concept of Discriminated Unions.
**Answer:** Discriminated unions use a common property (discriminant) to distinguish between union members. They enable type-safe handling of different object shapes and are useful for state management and API responses.

## 29. What is the `satisfies` operator in TypeScript?
**Answer:** The `satisfies` operator ensures a value matches a type constraint while preserving the most specific inferred type. It provides type safety without widening the type unnecessarily.

## 30. What are Higher-Order Types and provide examples?
**Answer:** Higher-order types are types that operate on other types, similar to higher-order functions. Examples include mapped types, conditional types, and utility types like `ReturnType<T>` or `Parameters<T>` that extract information from function types.
